# 3drvm

This repository contains the **JAX implementation** of the **Implicit Deep Random Vortex Network (3D-iDRVN)**, a neural network‚Äìbased Random Vortex Method for simulating incompressible fluid flows in **three-dimensional, wall-bounded domains**.

Unlike classical numerical solvers (finite differences, finite elements, spectral methods), this approach is **grid-free** and avoids explicit evaluation of the **Biot‚ÄìSavart kernel**, making it suitable for geometrically complex domains.  

The method combines a **probabilistic vortex representation of the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations** with deep neural networks and a novel **loss function**.
